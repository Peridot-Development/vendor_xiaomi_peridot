<!-- Vendor mapping file -->
<!-- Sample UUID to list of UIDs mapping file -->

<!-- UUID: Universally Unique IDentifier -->
<!-- 16 Byte UUID need to be generated by vendors to add new entry -->
<!-- As per global platform access control spec, UUID is expected to be of -->
<!-- length 20 bytes. While using this UUID, it is expected to be -->
<!-- automatically padded with ffffffff in initial 4 bytes of 20 Byte length -->

<!-- UID: user identifier of the service -->

<!-- This mapping file should contain an entry for VTS tests, since VTS -->
<!-- tests run as root, user identifier 0 should be mapped to its -->
<!-- corresponding UUID to allow VTS tests to access secure element -->
<!-- For VTS tests use UID: 0 and UUID: 9f36407ead0639fc966f14dde7970f68 -->
